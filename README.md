# Security-Alert-System
The Security Alert System is a simple Arduino project that uses a PIR sensor to detect human movement within 15-20 feet. When motion is detected, the Arduino activates a buzzer and LED as an alarm to warn intruders. It works 24/7 without internet, is low cost, reliable, and easy to build for home or office security.
